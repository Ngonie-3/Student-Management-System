# Student-Management-System
This project develops a java swing application that manages students via SQL database, that is the application can do operations 
such as adding students, updating student information and deleting students. Not only is the application limited to students but also it manages admins whom alter student details.
The same operations as those on students can be found on admins as well, and each admin is assigned a unique username and password, in order to access the student details and make changes.
