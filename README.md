# Student-Management-System
This project develops a java swing application that manages students via SQL database, that is the application can do operations 
such as adding students, updating student information and deleting students. Not only is the application limited to students but also it manages admins whom alter student details.
The same operations as those on students can be found on admins as well, and each admin is assigned a unique username and password, in order to access the student details and make changes. 
Hotkeys are also applicable to the application that is one can go to the home page and logout using a combination of keys on the keyboard. The keys are shown on the icons at the menu bar of the application. And of course wrong user/admin credentials will prompt a shaking frame which will display a error message.
